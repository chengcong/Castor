# Castor

Who is Castor? Castor, in Greek mythology, is the mortal counterpart to his twin brother Pollux. When Castor was killed, his twin brother asked Zeus to share his immortality with him and therefore they became immortalized in the constollations as the Gemini.

What is Castor? Castor is a Gameboy emulator I wrote in order to learn how hardware systems work better. I wrote another interpreter for the Chip8, however; it was awfully simple and didn't give me a great understanding of how emulators worked.
